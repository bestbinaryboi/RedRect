# RedRect
created by bestbinaryboi

This is a mod of one of my other projects (Vaudedash) for B.A.D productions
and uses the same engine. Since that project was abandon I have made this game as a side project.
Since this game already has an ok code base and nobody is judging me every step of the way it might
not be abondoned as quickly. This is gonna be a weird type of platformer game. I'm just gonna do anything I want with it.

I have not released a demo yet.
Stay tuned ig
